# **📱 Course Management App**
## 🚀 Project Overview
Welcome to the Course Management App! This application allows users to view, search, filter, and add courses, integrating data from data.gov.sg. Users can also see course details, including entry requirements for specific courses.

### 🏆 Learning Goals
Collaborate using Git & GitHub in a single shared repository.
Learn merge conflict resolution through hands-on experience.
Develop a mobile application with UI, navigation, and API integration.
Work with REST APIs to retrieve and manage course data.
Implement search & filter functionality for enhanced user experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React Native (Expo)
Backend API: Data fetched from data.gov.sg
State Management: useState, useEffect
Navigation: React Navigation
UI Components: FlatList, Picker, TextInput, Buttons

## 🔧 Step 1: Set Up Your Repository
### 1️⃣ Repository Creation
One team member ("Merge Manager") creates a GitHub repository.
Invite all team members as collaborators.
Everyone clones the repository to their local machine using:
git clone <repository-url>

### 2️⃣ Git Collaboration Workflow (No Branches!)
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
npm install

npm start  # Starts Metro Bundler
npm run android  # Runs on Android Emulator
npm run ios  # Runs on iOS Simulator (Mac only)

## 🌍 Step 2: Design & Deploy Your API
### 1️⃣ UI/Navigation Developer
Create the Home Screen to display courses.
Build the Add Course and Modify Course screens.
Implement navigation between screens.

### **1️⃣ API Integrator**
Fetch and display course data using data.gov.sg API.
Implement search bar to filter by Course Name or Course Code.
Implement school filter dropdown.
Implement auto-incrementing course codes.

### **3️⃣ Merge Manager**
Ensure smooth Git collaboration (pull before push, help resolve conflicts).
Test API responses using Postman or a browser.
Merge and finalize team code.

## 🕒 Development Timeline
